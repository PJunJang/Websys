Lab6<PHP Calculator>
Name: Paul Jang
  For this lab, I used the provided php file as a template to work off. 
  1. I created another abstract class named 'Operation_single' to handle calculations that requires only one value.
    The followings are of the case above. This class contains a constructor that passes in only one argument($o1).
    1) Sqrt
    2) Squared
    3) Log
    4) Ln
    5) 10^x (Tenp in my code)
    6) e^x (Ep in my code)
    7) Sin
    8) Cos
    9) Tan
   For those listed above, calculation works if user puts only one value in the first input box.
  2. Operation => abstract class 
    This class contains a constructor that passes in two different argument($o1, $o2).
    1) Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
    2) Power
   For those listed above, calulation works only if user puts values in both input boxes.
