Lab 6 - Web Optimization
Name <Paul Jang>
  Optimizations Implemented:
  1. I made an external javascript file "script.js" and put all the javascript portion into the external file.
  2. I made an external css file "style.css" and put all the style portion into the external file.
  3. In javascript, I tried to group up all the elements called by "getElementById" setting them in variables.
    ex) var comb1 = document.getElementByID('comb1')
