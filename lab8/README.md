Lab 8
Name : Paul Jang

## Part 1 : lab8.json
File has been included in the folder.

## Part 2 : front-end
In the lab8.js file, I created a function to loop over json data and append required values to each array(lec_array, lab_array).
Once it appends all the data into the array, it should be displayed in position of html where it's been selected with specified id.
Simple css has been implemented to style the structures.

## Part 3 : back-end
I set the root page as login page(index.php) and connected it with database created through phpmyadmin.
The database has been exported and included with files. => "login_insecure.sql"
The logout session destroys the server connected and is accessible through the href button in the "lab8.html" which redirects user back to the login page(index.php).
