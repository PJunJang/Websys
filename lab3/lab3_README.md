 Page directory:
  ## index.html:
 Index page which becomes a root of the whole web system. In this file, I used Bootstrap framework and utilized it throughout the page.
 First, I created a navigation bar on top to help users easily navigate through the information contents. Navbar was built upon bootstrap
 api. Under the navbar, I placed body contents in container and put them in row/column to position contents in a same row when required. (Image, Text, Contact Info)
 At the bottom of the page, I placed 5 static news with their hyperlinks(href) of title, and short summary for each.
 For footer, I also brought bootstrap features to apply more intuitive buttons to link to each ITWS social network account.(is applied to every other page as well)
## faculty.html:
Faculty page illustrates five main faculty members of ITWS department. 
For each professor, I placed their profile picture and introduction as row/column to place next to each other.
Same as in the index.html. navbar has been implemented and it is consistent along every other page too.
## undergrad.html grad. html:
For each undergrad and grad info page, I tried to put all the information from the original ITWS page to deliver correct and helpful contents.
Bootstrap list was applied here and there to emphasize intuition of each list(outcome, requirement courses, etc).
