#index.html
  1. I tried to make it's lay out neat and clear.
  2. Used bootstrap for header/footer.
  3. Imported "text.js" file in order to make it call json file into html.
# css
  For Css, I used quite simple styling.
    1. Using different id, class tags, I aligned the features in form.
# json
  imported and downloaded in my hard.
# js
  didn't work at the end.
